# Welcome to The 404st!

We are the 404st, because technically we don't exist...

# Unit Log

## LOG #535 | CC - 0404 - 4040 | Rotation 92

The 404th Company, 6th Sector Army of the Grand Army of the Republic. Under Black Sword Command. Our primary duties are the defense of the Deep Core worlds. Based in the Praxlis System.


Near as we can tell, that was what was supposed to be issued for the 404th Company. However, in the surprise of nearly 21,000 other Grand Army of the Republic companies the 404th was not filled in order with the rest. 403rd? Right there. 405th? Easy to find with their unique paint. But in those early years no 404th trooper could be found. 


You see, the Kaminoans did everything themselves - no clones' help. Everything in secret. All to meet the quota. Well someone's hand slipped on the datapad ending a long day, and so the 404st replaced the 404th.


The error was promptly caught. Of course; the Kaminoans are perfectionists. However, that does not mean the 404st was corrected. No. The 404th did muster out with the 6th Reserve Army, but these were fresh shiny clones, barely out of the tubes. Early in the making of a Galactic Army there were other uses for a unit of 144 clones that did not exist on paper.


Someone had to test the simulations, the equipment, the tactics.... You could say we ... found some errors.
